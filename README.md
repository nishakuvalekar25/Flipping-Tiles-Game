# Flipping Tiles Game

The Flipping Tiles memory game involves pairs of face-down tiles with numbers or figures. Players take turns flipping two tiles; if they match, they are removed; if not, they are flipped back. The game continues until all tiles are successfully matched and removed, testing and challenging the player's memory.
